# Repository structure and file policy

This document owns placement of durable source, generated files, and evidence.
[Scope](SCOPE.md) owns platform and functional decisions;
[installation](../INSTALLATION.md) owns the available setup commands.
The layout separates source, tests, documentation, and tools while distinguishing maintenance from the approved Excel/VBA prototype.

## Current layout

| Path | Purpose today and intended content |
| --- | --- |
| `src/` | Production source boundary |
| `src/modules/` | Prototype VBA modules: calculation engine (`CORE_*`) and workbook macros (`M_*`), issues #20 and #30 |
| `src/workbook/` | Macro-free workbook template `FRTB_Template.xlsx`, generated from `src/modules` (#30) |
| `tests/` | Verification source: independent Python reference, reconciliation and tooling tests |
| `tests/modules/` | VBA test modules imported into development builds (`TEST_*`) |
| `docs/` | Authoritative versioned scope, governance, structure, methodology, validation, and milestone documentation |
| `docs/assets/` | Documentation images and their sources |
| `docs/evidence/` | Dated, sanitized evidence records bound to reviewed commits |
| `docs/Milestones/` | Detailed milestone guides |
| `tools/` | Tooling index; prototype build, VBA synchronization into an existing workbook and their `.cmd` launchers, LibreOffice runner, VBA lint, expected-value generator and Excel evidence validator; label tooling remains in `.github/scripts/` |
| `.github/` | Labels, forms, universal maintenance/analytics workflows, prototype checks, dependency updates and the Excel evidence policy |
| Root | Entry documentation, licenses, contribution/setup guidance, and repository-control files |

Each new root has a purposeful README. Add further subdirectories with their
first real file and documented purpose, rather than creating empty engine
modules, fixtures, or placeholder test runners. Source extensions, runtime
dependencies, and build commands must follow an approved platform decision.
The label catalogue's `application` profile is not an engine architecture
decision.

## Source of truth

Reviewable production source belongs in `src/`; test source and independently
specified expected results belong in `tests/`. Tools must not become a second
calculation engine. Versioned documents govern the repository; issue discussions
record decisions and evidence and should link to the resulting source.

Do not commit client portfolios, real counterparty identifiers, production
exports, credentials, private keys, or unsanitized logs. Examples and fixtures
must be synthetic and document their origin and usage rights.
An ignore rule is a tracking aid, not a data-security control.

## Generated files, workbooks, and evidence

| Material | Policy |
| --- | --- |
| Generated build/release packages | Keep local output under ignored root `build/`, `dist/`, or `release-assets/`; publish only through a separately approved release procedure |
| Test run output | Keep disposable output under ignored root `test-results/` or `test-output/` |
| Durable reviewed evidence | Add selected sanitized records under `docs/evidence/`; record commit, environment, commands, results, and limitations |
| Synthetic test inputs and expected values | Add `tests/fixtures/` and `tests/expected/` when real cases exist; record independent provenance, units, signs, tolerances, and reference versions |
| Excel workbooks, add-ins, and templates | Ignored by default; only `src/workbook/FRTB_Template.xlsx` is currently allowed by exact rooted exception |
| Local dependencies and environments | Ignored caches/installations; commit necessary manifests and locks when a real ecosystem is introduced |

The approved template exists at that path for prototype builds; this does
not approve distribution of other workbook files or a supported engine. A
template change needs a reviewable explanation of sheets, names, formulas,
data, and compatibility because Git treats Office packages as binary.
Never include confidential inputs or hidden credentials in a template.

Evidence must bind to the reviewed commit and identify what ran. A static
check is not runtime execution. Future numerical expected values must come
from a published reference or a separately derived calculation, never the
implementation under test. Missing or skipped execution is not a pass.
Do not retain every disposable log as authoritative evidence.

## Editing and Git behavior

The root controls already define:

- `.editorconfig`: LF for documentation/configuration/tooling, 2-space
  indentation for JavaScript/JSON/YAML, and CRLF/4 spaces for exported VBA.
- `.gitattributes`: text normalization, VBA working-tree CRLF and diff driver,
  LF supporting text, and binary Office packages/UserForm companions.
- `.gitignore`: generated output, Office locks, secrets, caches, and local
  environments, with the exact approved workbook-template exception.

VBA encoding is intentionally not forced. Do not add working-tree encoding
or renormalize existing files without a separate justified compatibility
check. Markdown may retain intentional hard-break spaces.
The settings describe file handling; they do not select an engine platform.

## Excel/VBA source policy

Excel/VBA is approved for the prototype ([Scope](SCOPE.md)); the long-term
platform decision remains open. Record supported hosts and the build/import
procedure before claiming workbook support. The following source-first
requirements apply:

1. Commit reviewable exported `.bas`, `.cls`, and `.frm` files under
   documented source roots. Keep each required `.frx` beside its `.frm`.
   Include workbook and sheet document-module code; a binary workbook must
   never be the only record of a code change.
2. Keep the macro-free template at the approved path and construct local
   runnable workbooks from the template and reviewed exported source.
   Document component names, import order, sheet CodeNames, references,
   encoding, and production-versus-test component selection.
3. Export workbook edits back to reviewable source before committing.
   Verify a source-to-workbook-to-export round trip against the candidate
   commit, recording workbook/template digests and comparison limitations.
   Never silently overwrite workbook code or treat a source-only rebind as
   proof of a new runtime run.
4. Require actual host compilation and scenario/test execution for VBA
   changes. Evidence identifies the exact commit, Excel/OS/bitness,
   workbook digest, suites/assertions, results, failures, and skipped work.
   Independently specified numeric expectations remain a separate requirement.

The prototype has source export/build helpers and a LibreOffice runtime gate.
Excel host compilation, execution and the source round trip remain unverified
in #28/#30; those gaps must stay visible.

**Prototype implementation (issues #20, #30).** Exported modules live in
`src/modules` and `tests/modules`; the committed template at the approved
path is generated from them by `tools/build_template.py` (LibreOffice) or
`tools/Build-Workbook.ps1 -Template` (Excel), and `tests/test_template.py`
checks that it matches a fresh build and carries no VBA project, controls or
personal properties. Excel builds start from the template and
`M_Setup.FinishWorkbook` adds the buttons and window settings. Remaining gap:
the only runtime executed so far is LibreOffice Calc in VBA-compatibility
mode, which is not Excel host evidence (#28); the Excel round trip and its
digests belong to #28 and #30. See [validation](validation.md).
