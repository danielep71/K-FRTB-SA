# Roadmap

This roadmap records the milestone plan approved on October 18, 2026,
from the repository setup to the first certified release. Milestones carry no
dates or release promises. Each milestone after v0.3.0 is created on GitHub
when its predecessor has fixed its scope, as [governance](GOVERNANCE.md)
requires; the issue tracker is authoritative for current progress.

On October 27, 2026 the milestones were renumbered one step up: the setup
milestone, first named v0.0.1, became v0.1.0, and every later milestone moved
with it. The integration branch `release/v0.2.0` superseded `release/v0.1.0`
the same day (#117). Dated records
keep the names in effect when they were written.

## 🗺️ Milestone plan

| Milestone | Objective | Exit condition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ✅ v0.1.0 — Repo setup | Repository foundations: governance, protections, CI, issue management and the release procedure | Required checks active and release procedure verified; analytics kept separate from the certification path. Closed October 18, 2026 |
| 🧪 v0.2.0 — SA prototype | Consolidate the existing prototype: SBM for the five implemented risk classes, non-securitization DRC and RRAO | Excel build and run documented, sample reconciliation, source round trip verified and limits stated explicitly |
| 📐 v0.3.0 — Regulatory baseline and certification scope | Fix exactly what will be certified: standard and version, any CRR profile, included products, exclusions and interpretations | Approved requirement → source → formula → parameter → test matrix; the methodology decisions the scope needs are resolved; the meaning of certification, the validator's role, the target platform and the supported Excel environments are recorded |
| ⚙️ v0.4.0 — Calculation engine completion | Complete and correct the engine for the approved scope, progressively separating calculation from worksheet access | Every included requirement implemented with independently derived expected values, input/output contracts defined and no known calculation defect open |
| 🗂️ v0.5.0 — Workbook and user workflow | Guided workbook use: inputs, parameters, default restore, run, diagnostics and results | Full flow verified in Excel; understandable errors, no stale results, safe application state and documented handling of confidential portfolio data |
| 🔍 v0.6.0 — Independent validation | Validate formulas, parameters and results through a review independent of the implementation | Intermediate and final results reconciled, official cases where available, independently derived cases, and anomalies resolved or formally excluded from scope |
| 🛡️ v0.7.0 — Operational hardening | Robustness, performance and compatibility on the supported Excel environments | Malformed inputs, representative portfolios, repeated runs, error recovery and agreed run times all pass |
| 📦 v0.9.0 — Release candidate and certification dossier | Freeze the candidate and prepare the certification dossier | Rebuildable package, updated manual and limits, full regression suite on the candidate and final review complete; any later change needs the relevant checks again |
| 🏁 v1.0.0 — First certified release | Approve and publish the first certified version | Methodological, numerical and technical approval on the same commit and workbook; tag, package (rebuildable from template and sources, with recorded digests), evidence and release notes consistent |

v0.8.0 is reserved for an iteration the hardening or validation work may
require. Independent expected values accompany every calculation increment
from v0.4.0 onward; v0.6.0 is the formal review by someone other than the
implementer, not the first check. Every milestone names its own Excel
evidence, which only a Windows desktop Excel host can produce. Versions,
tags and release evidence follow [Releasing](../RELEASING.md).

| Issue | Deliverable |
| --- | --- |
| [#1](https://github.com/danielep71/K-FRTB-SA/issues/1) | Canonical labels, safe reconciliation, drift detection, and triage rules |
| [#2](https://github.com/danielep71/K-FRTB-SA/issues/2) | Effective GitHub settings, protection, security, required check and review verification |
| [#3](https://github.com/danielep71/K-FRTB-SA/issues/3) | Project identity, accurate scope, navigation, and starting instructions |
| [#4](https://github.com/danielep71/K-FRTB-SA/issues/4) | Governance, integration branches, contribution rules, and milestone guide |
| [#5](https://github.com/danielep71/K-FRTB-SA/issues/5) | Minimal source, test, documentation, and tooling structure |
| [#6](https://github.com/danielep71/K-FRTB-SA/issues/6) | Issue forms, PR template, and contribution/security policies |
| [#7](https://github.com/danielep71/K-FRTB-SA/issues/7) | Universal repository-integrity checks and dependency updates |
| [#8](https://github.com/danielep71/K-FRTB-SA/issues/8) | Release procedure and evidence-based setup closeout |
| [#23](https://github.com/danielep71/K-FRTB-SA/issues/23) | Traffic history: protected data branch and daily collection |
| [#25](https://github.com/danielep71/K-FRTB-SA/issues/25) | Label pruning guard |

The milestone closed without a tag or release. No main commit is both
setup-only and complete, so the closed milestone and the closeout record are
the setup baseline.

States were read back on October 27, 2026; the live milestone is authoritative.
At that checkpoint main and `release/v0.2.0` both pointed to `46ae228`, after
integrations #123 (version 0.2.0, the branch move and the website) and #128
(install-step timeout, preview image and wiki link). These merges do not
supply desktop Excel evidence. The [milestone guide](Milestones/v0.2.0.md)
and an [interim evaluation](evidence/2026-10-27-prototype-evaluation.md)
exist; the final closeout record follows the Excel run of #28 (#32).

The open methodology interpretations are documented as limits in the
[methodology](methodology.md); deciding them ([#29](https://github.com/danielep71/K-FRTB-SA/issues/29))
belongs to v0.3.0. The prototype informs the v0.3.0 scope and platform
decisions; it does not complete the later milestones' exit conditions.

## 📐 v0.3.0 — Regulatory baseline and certification scope

[Live milestone](https://github.com/danielep71/K-FRTB-SA/milestone/3),
integration branch `release/v0.3.0` (#132). It holds the methodology
decisions of
[#29](https://github.com/danielep71/K-FRTB-SA/issues/29); its exit condition is
in the plan above.
