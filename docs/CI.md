# 🧪 Repository checks and dependency updates

[![Scope: maintenance](https://img.shields.io/badge/checks-repository_maintenance-1D76DB)](../tools/check_repository.py)

## Run the same check locally

Use a Git clone, Python 3.12 or newer, Node.js with built-in fetch, and Git.
Install the one pinned configuration-parser package in a local environment:

```sh
python3 -m venv .venv-ci
.venv-ci/bin/python -m pip install -r .github/requirements.txt
.venv-ci/bin/python tools/check_repository.py
```

On Windows use `.venv-ci\Scripts\python` instead of `.venv-ci/bin/python`.
Run from the repository root. Stage new source and documentation before running
the command: it inspects paths returned by `git ls-files`, using their current
working-tree contents. It checks committed files even when the diff is empty.
It does not stage, commit, change labels, read secrets, or contact GitHub.
Installing the package requires access to the package registry; validation
after installation and all maintenance fixtures are offline.

## What the gate checks

- All tracked JSON and YAML parse successfully, with duplicate keys rejected.
  GitHub's YAML `on` key remains text. Workflow files have basic structural
  checks and external step actions use full commit SHAs. This is not complete
  GitHub Actions or issue-form schema validation.
- Tracked text has a final newline and no accidental trailing whitespace or
  extra EOF blank lines. Intentional Markdown hard breaks are allowed. VBA
  exports may use CRLF and Windows-1252. Binary assets are excluded according
  to Git's resolved `text` attribute from `.gitattributes`, including its
  macros and path overrides; the checker has no separate extension list.
- Common inline Markdown links/images and reference definitions outside code
  fences point to tracked repository files or directories. Anchors and remote
  URLs are not fetched or validated; this is not a complete Markdown parser.
- The universal workflow keeps its unconditional stable check and branch
  coverage. Dependabot covers the inspected ecosystems and intended branches.
- The existing label self-tests, manifest validation and read-only drift
  fixtures run once through their authoritative scripts. The path-filtered
  label workflows remain responsible for their own live evidence and trusted
  reconciliation; this runner does not duplicate their implementations.
- Offline maintenance tests under `tests/tooling` cover malformed/duplicate
  configuration (including non-standard JSON numeric constants), binary policy,
  broken links, whitespace, unpinned actions, narrowed trigger
  coverage, incorrect update targets, and the traffic collector's safeguards.

A failed prerequisite, validation error or failed child command exits nonzero.
The fixture suite includes clean input as well as deliberate failures. It
never deletes a live label or exports real traffic.

## Hosted check and protection handoff

Workflow: [Repository integrity](../.github/workflows/integrity.yml).
The job ID is `integrity`; the exact check name is **Repository integrity**.
The producer is **GitHub Actions** (app slug `github-actions`, app ID `15368`).
There is no matrix, job condition, path filter or changed-file shortcut.
PRs targeting `main` or `release/**`, and pushes to those branches, run the
same command on Ubuntu 24.04. Manual dispatch is also available after
default-branch activation. Checkout is pinned to the existing reviewed SHA,
credentials are not persisted, permissions are `contents: read`, timeout is
10 minutes, and newer runs cancel older runs for the same workflow/ref.

The check name and app identity are required by the main and release
rulesets, and main must be up to date before merging; issue #2 records the
readback and a representative blocked PR (October 18, 2026). A task PR proves
the hosted command; release-to-main integration and synchronization into the
prototype branch (#31) install the workflow on the respective branch lines.
The prototype workflow installs both requirements manifests in its own test
environment before pytest discovers the shared maintenance tests. Its
LibreOffice installation step stops after 8 minutes, within the job's
20-minute limit, so a hung package mirror fails early (#124). The
universal job remains a separate, runtime-independent check.
Do not require a check on a line before installing it there.

## 🔄 Dependabot policy

The configuration must reach the default branch before GitHub schedules
version updates. The temporary maintenance successor was approved in
[#51](https://github.com/danielep71/K-FRTB-SA/issues/51#issuecomment-6254417218)
on October 18, 2026, and the entries moved to `release/v0.2.0` with the
integration branch on October 27 (#118); the configuration was activated
on main through #120.
PRs have no milestone under the issue-only policy (#104).
The setup branch `release/v0.0.1` receives no version-update
PRs; it was deleted after the closeout (#62):

| Ecosystem and manifest location | Version-update PR target |
| --- | --- |
| GitHub Actions, `/` | `release/v0.2.0` |
| pip, `/.github/requirements.txt` (PyYAML configuration parser) | `release/v0.2.0` |
| pip, `/tests/requirements.txt` (prototype NumPy, openpyxl, pytest) | `release/v0.2.0` |

The two previous Actions entries are consolidated into one. Both pip
manifest locations remain covered; no dependency is copied into the historical
setup branch. The integrity gate rejects duplicate entries, retired or wrong
targets, lost ecosystem/directory coverage and any `milestone` setting.
There is no npm package manifest: the label scripts use Node built-ins. No npm updater or
other absent ecosystem is configured. Each entry runs weekly, limits open
PRs to five, assigns `danielep71`, and sets exactly P3 plus type labels.
Maintainers must still verify all metadata during triage and put any owning
issue in the appropriate milestone.

Non-default `target-branch` settings govern version updates, not security
update PRs. The existing Dependabot alerts stay enabled; automatic security
update PRs remain off under the recorded settings baseline. Enabling or
retargeting them is a new explicit settings decision (#2 is closed), not an
assertion made by this file. See the [official options reference](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/reference/supply-chain-security/dependabot-options-reference).

## Issue-only milestones

[Keep milestones issue-only](../.github/workflows/pr-milestones.yml) removes
milestone assignments from PRs only (#104). It handles `opened`, `reopened`,
`edited` and `milestoned` PR activity, plus a daily full reconciliation at
03:17 UTC, manual dispatch and reviewed workflow changes pushed to main.
PR events and the schedule always run the reconciliation; a push or manual
dispatch runs it only from the default branch, so no other branch's copy of
the workflow gets the write token. `tools/check_repository.py` requires this
condition. The full scan includes open, closed and merged
PRs. It uses unfiltered creation-order pagination so removing assignments does
not shift the collection. A 100-page bound, malformed response, API error or
failed removal fails the run rather than claiming success.

The workflow runs trusted inline Python without checkout, third-party actions,
PR code, PR text interpolation or custom secrets. Its token has only
`pull-requests: write` for PR metadata updates and listing; all other
permissions are absent. Each mutation first reads the live issues endpoint and
refuses to modify an object without a `pull_request` marker. An unset milestone
is a no-op. Offline fixtures exercise pagination, actual issue refusal,
idempotence and error propagation against the workflow's inline implementation.

Default-branch activation is required. The maintainer's October 27 instruction
to apply this rule to past and future PRs is recorded in #104; focused policy
PRs activated it on main and synchronized release/v0.1.0. This activation does
not integrate unrelated release work. The activation push performs the historical
cleanup; daily runs also cover changes by bots whose events may not trigger
another workflow. Event delivery and scheduled runs can be delayed or blocked
by GitHub Actions policies or outages. If a run fails, inspect it and rerun the
trusted workflow; do not claim synchronous assignment prevention. The query
`repo:danielep71/K-FRTB-SA is:pr has:milestone` should return zero.

## Evidence boundaries

This gate checks repository maintenance. It does not execute Excel, run the
FRTB engine, validate formulas, certify regulation, or substitute for runtime
and independent numerical evidence. The prototype's separate checks already
cover VBA lint, Python reference tests and LibreOffice reconciliation on its
branch. Excel build/compile/runtime evidence is tracked in #28, methodology
decisions in #29 (v0.3.0); prototype synchronization was completed in #31. Future engine gates
must retain independently derived expectations and name the actual host and
commit, following [Scope](SCOPE.md) and the [structure policy](REPOSITORY_STRUCTURE.md).
